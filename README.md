# Customer Segmentation Model  
## Overview  
This project aims to build a **Customer Segmentation Model** to group customers based on their behavior, demographics, and engagement patterns. The insights derived from these segments help businesses improve marketing strategies, enhance customer retention, and optimize resource allocation.  
## Key Features  
- **Data Handling:** Import and preprocess customer data from various sources.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Create meaningful features such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (RFM), customer lifetime value, and churn probability.  
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Apply machine learning techniques like K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering to segment customers effectively.  
- **Visualization:** Develop interactive dashboards in Power BI to explore customer segments and trends.  
- **Churn & Retention Analysis:** Identify patterns related to customer churn and retention strategies.  
- **Actionable Insights:** Provide business-friendly recommendations based on customer behavior.  
## Tools Used  
- **Python:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and clustering algorithms.  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Exploratory data analysis and model development.  
- **Power BI:** Data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.  
## How It Works  
1. **Data Collection:** Load customer data from CSV or a database.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize data, and create relevant features.  
3. **Segmentation:** Apply clustering algorithms to group customers based on similarities.  
4. **Visualization:** Use Power BI to present insights through charts and dashboards.  
5. **Business Insights:** Generate recommendations for marketing and retention strategies.  
## Expected Outcomes  
- Identification of distinct customer groups.  
- Improved targeting for marketing campaigns.  
- Enhanced customer retention strategies.  
- Data-driven decision-making for business growth.  
## Future Enhancements  
- Integration with real-time data sources.  
- Advanced predictive modeling for churn analysis.
- Automated reporting and recommendations.
